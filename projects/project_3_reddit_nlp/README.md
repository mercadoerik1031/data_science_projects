# Reddit Post Classifier Project

## Overview
This project involves the creation of a machine learning model to classify Reddit posts into two categories: r/movies and r/books. The process is divided into three main notebooks covering data collection, analysis, and modeling.

## Notebooks

### 1. Web Scraping
- **Purpose**: Collect posts from Reddit to serve as data for the classification model.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Setting up scraping tools.
  - Extracting posts from the r/movies and r/books subreddits.
  - Saving the initial dataset.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Purpose**: Analyze the scraped data to identify trends and prepare it for modeling.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Cleaning the dataset.
  - Visualizing data distributions and interrelationships.
  - Identifying potential features for modeling.

### 3. Classification
- **Purpose**: Develop a machine learning model to classify the posts accurately.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Training models (Random Forest and SVM).
  - Evaluating and tuning model performance.
  - Analyzing feature importance and model coefficients.

## Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates the ability to automate the classification of Reddit posts, enhancing content targeting and moderation capabilities. The detailed steps in each notebook guide through the scraping, analysis, and modeling phases, providing insights and tools for effective data-driven decision-making in content management.
